    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chef John's campfire carnitas require some tending and attention while they slow cook in a campfire or in a
        charcoal grill, but you will be rewarded with the most succulent, tender pork imaginable. Campfire-friendly ways
        to serve include on tortilla chips, in a bun, or as nachos
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds boneless pork shoulder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt, or 1 teaspoon per pound of meat</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>1 white onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 Fresno chili pepper, seeded and halved, or more to taste</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, skin on</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut pork into 2-inch pieces. Stack 2 (7x10x3-inch) disposable foil baking pans and transfer in the pork.
            Season with salt, pepper, and oregano, and toss with your hands until everything is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and crimp tightly around the edges. Place on top of
            another large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and then wrap the foil up over the pan. All seams should be
            rolled facing up. Repeat with 2 more sheets of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place pan next to a campfire, or in a charcoal grill, and arrange the burning coals evenly around the pan.
            Wrap a sheet pan in foil, place over the pan, and arrange some charcoal on top.</li>
        <li>Use a probe or laser thermometer to check the temperature on the surface of the bottom pan, as well as the
            ambient temperature next to the pan. Try to maintain a constant temperature of between 250 to 300 degrees F
            (120 to 150 degrees C). To do this, move charcoal further away or closer to the pan as needed. If cooking
            next to a campfire and the pan is getting more heat from one direction than the other, rotate the pan
            occasionally. Cook until falling-apart tender, 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from the fire, and let rest for up to 1 hour, or serve immediately. Carefully cut foil away and
            peel back. Serve made into tacos, nachos, or enjoyed in hot dog or hamburger buns.</li>
